## Description

I developed a pizza ordering application to demonstrate my animation skills in Flutter. This project highlights:

- **Browse Pizzas**: A list of pizzas that users can scroll through, each with detailed descriptions.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can easily add pizzas to their cart with interactive animations.
- **View Cart**: A dynamic cart page displays the contents with smooth transitions and interactions.

This project showcases my expertise in building engaging, animated user interfaces that provide a smooth, enjoyable experience.
